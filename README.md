building a C# datetime example to learn to convert from JS to C#

building a C# example based on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/getfullyear-method-date-javascript
so that I can learn the mechanism and then be able to convert from the Javascript DateTime format into the C# date-time format.

They appear to have different base-dates (JS being Jan 1, 1970) and C# being different (starting in 1900)
